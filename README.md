This repository offers a collection of C language examples developed with the SDCC compiler for the CH552 microcontroller. It serves as a valuable resource for both beginners and experienced developers, providing versatile and cost-effective solutions for CH552-based projects.

## CH552 Microcontroller Features

The CH552 microcontroller boasts an enhanced E8051 core MCU compatible with the MCS51 instruction set, featuring:

- **Instruction Efficiency**: 79% of its instructions are single-byte, single-cycle, achieving execution speeds approximately 8 to 15 times faster than the standard MCS51.
- **Cost-Effectiveness**: Its optimized architecture makes it ideal for low-cost applications without compromising performance.

## Included Examples

This repository encompasses various functionalities, including:

- **LED Blinking (Blink)**
- **Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC)**
- **Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)**
- **Timers**
- **Interrupts**
- **Bit-banging for I2C Communication**
    - **Control of SSD1306 OLED Display**
    - **Control of MPU6050 Accelerometer**
- **Control of WS2812 LEDs**

**Note**: Examples are regularly updated to enhance project development.

## Getting Started

Manual installation of the SDCC compiler is required to compile the examples. The following steps provide a guide for setting up the SDCC compiler on Windows / GNU/Linux:
